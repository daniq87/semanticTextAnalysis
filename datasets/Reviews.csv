Great location, wonderful hotel, spacious room, comfy bed, dogfriendly hotel, tasty breakfast. Easy to find a place to park nearby. Would come back again!
Clean , quite , safe , close to shopping mall. Weak , and slow internet connection
Breakfast was very basic, we just needed a bed and a loo overnight and basically that's what we got, on the plus side it was friendly and reasonably clean. I would stay there again if going to the Manchester arena as it was only 5 minutes walk away.
We came to see a show, so the location was perfect. We were offered a loyalty card, and a discount for the public car park we used. Beds are fantastic, and we slept very well.
First of all, the location of this place is great: the property itself is beautiful, it's an easy and short walk (like 5 minutes) into the town of Soller, and from there very easy to hop on the tram to Port de Soller for swimming/ restaurants/ boat tours, or the train to Palma. It's also really well located to hike (note, it is a serious hike! :) ) to Deia and the beach there, which is a really beautiful day out. But besides the location, the staff here have gone to so much trouble to make sure that every detail has had some attention, which I really appreciated. They have good taste. The room was pristine, everything was easy to find, and they took time when we first arrived to answer all of our questions about activities in the area. The morning breakfasts by the pool and the orange trees are so beautiful, and have great food. I really can't imagine anyone being disappointed here.
This is a beautiful, cozy little hotel that feels more like a bed and breakfast. The staff was extremely helpful, all the way from complimentary drinks at check-in to recommending restaurants and places to see. The rooms were lovely, modern, clean, and comfortable. And the antique furniture and art work made us feel more like we were staying in someone's home rather than a hotel. Plus, the location was very convenient. We would definitely stay here again.
